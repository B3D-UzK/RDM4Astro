The FAIR principles, which stand for **Findable**, **Accessible**, **Interoperable**, and **Reusable**, are a set of guidelines proposed by a consortium of scientists and organizations to support the reusability of digital assets\[1\]. These principles are designed to ensure that data is easily located, retrieved, and used, and that the necessary metadata is provided to allow others to understand and reuse the data\[2\]. Here are questions that could be included in a survey for institutions working on astronomical data to assess their adherence to the FAIR principles:

## Findable

1.  Do you assign a unique and persistent identifier to each dataset?

2.  Are your datasets easily discoverable through search engines or data discovery tools?

3.  Do you provide detailed metadata for each dataset?

4.  Is the metadata consistently structured and standardized?

5.  Do you use community-accepted vocabularies in your metadata?

6.  Are your datasets indexed in a searchable resource?

7.  Do you have a system in place to ensure the persistence of dataset identifiers?

8.  Do you use standard identifier schemes (e.g., DOI, ORCID) for your datasets?

9.  Are your datasets and their metadata findable by machines (i.e., machine-readable)?

10. Do you provide clear instructions on how to find your datasets?

## Accessible

1.  Are your datasets openly accessible online?

2.  If your datasets are not openly accessible, do you provide clear and accessible information about how to access them?

5.  Are your datasets accessible in a way that is compliant with relevant data protection and privacy regulations?

6.  Do you provide an API for programmatically accessing your datasets?

7.  Are your datasets accessible without proprietary software?

8.  Do you provide support for users who have difficulty accessing your datasets?

9.  Are your datasets and their metadata accessible by machines (i.e., machine-readable)?

10. Do you provide clear instructions on how to access your datasets?

## Interoperable

1.  Do you use community-accepted vocabularies in your datasets?

5.  Are your datasets and their metadata interoperable with other systems and platforms?
6.  Do you use standard data models for your datasets?
7.  Do you provide tools or services to facilitate data interoperability?
8.  Are your datasets interoperable with common data analysis tools?
9.  Are your datasets and their metadata interoperable by machines (i.e., machine-readable)?
10. Do you provide clear instructions on how to integrate your datasets with other datasets?

## Reusable

1.  Do you provide a clear and accessible data usage license for each dataset?

2.  Do you provide detailed provenance information for each dataset?

3.  Are your datasets accompanied by comprehensive documentation?

4.  Do you provide information about the data collection methods used for each dataset?

5.  Do you provide information about the quality control procedures applied to each dataset?

6.  Are your datasets reusable in different contexts?

7.  Do you provide tools or services to facilitate data reuse?

8.  Are your datasets reusable with common data analysis tools?

9.  Are your datasets and their metadata reusable by machines (i.e., machine-readable)?

10. Do you provide clear instructions on how to reuse your datasets?
