# Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)

An Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) is a digital tool that mimics the format of a paper lab notebook, allowing researchers to record protocols, observations, notes, and other data using their computer or mobile device. ELNs offer numerous benefits compared to traditional paper notebooks, such as promoting good data management practices, ensuring data security, facilitating auditing, and enabling collaboration. Certain ELNs can also manage inventories, track equipment maintenance schedules, and provide specialized scientific tools for tasks like chemical drawing or molecular biology.

## Why should we use ELN ?

ELNs align with FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), endorsed by the research community and organizations like the National Institutes of Health. They enable effective oversight by Principal Investigators (PIs) or Core Facility managers. Collaborative data sharing and documentation become effortless with ELNs. They eliminate challenges arising from illegible handwriting and damaged paper notebooks. ELNs also safeguard against data loss when researchers transition. Certain ELNs integrate seamlessly with platforms like Mendeley, Dataverse, PubMed, and other applications, streamlining the publishing and research processes.

## Using computers during experiments

1\. Dedicated Tablets: Providing researchers with dedicated tablets specifically for lab use can help streamline computer-related tasks in the lab setting.

2\. Voice Input or OCR Plugins: Utilizing voice input or optical character recognition (OCR) plugins can facilitate data entry, making it easier and faster to record observations and other experiment-related information.

3\. Time-Saving Features: Leveraging time-saving features within an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN), such as linking experiments to raw data files and results, and automatically timestamping entries, helps maintain data provenance and efficiency.

4\. Integration with Research Software: Integrating the ELN with other research software enables seamless data capture and information management, simplifying the overall experimental process.
